== Description ==

unfake.it URL shortener Plugin for Twitter Tools works as a WordPress plugin and (hopefully) gets an URL as inbound parameter, shortens it by using unfake.it API and sends back the shortened URL as outbound return string.

== Details ==

You need Twitter Tools v1.6 (or above) for this plugin to work!

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Create a folder named `tt_unfake_it` in your `wp-contents/plugins/` directory. (This should happen automatically, once you unzipped the archive; just make sure, the location is correct.)
3. Put the `tt_unfake_it.php` file into the `wp-content/plugins/tt_unfake_it/` directory. (This should happen automatically, once you unzipped the archive; just make sure, the location is correct.)
4. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for 'unfake.it URL shortener for Twitter Tools'.

== Configuration ==

There is nothing to be configured since your Twitter configuration will happen by/with your Twitter Tools plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't know where to configure my Twitter account =

Your Twitter account ain't configured for and within this plugin. As mentioned above, you need the plugin Twitter Tools, where your account has to be configured.

= What if I install your plugin and don't even use Twitter Tools. Will your plugin harm my WordPress blog? =

No! Unless you use Twitter Tools, simply nothing will happen.

== Screenshots ==

1. you won't have to shorten your post URL by yourself, as you could do on the unfake.it website: screenshot-1.jpg
2. to make this plugin work without any further configuration, just make sure, you enabled twittering your posts in the Twitter Tools Options: screenshot-2.jpg (WP administration: `Settings`, `Twitter Tools`)
