== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Create a folder named 'tt_unfake_it' in your wp-contents/plugins/ directory. (This should happen automatically, once you unzipped the archive; just make sure, the location is correct.)
3. Put the 'tt_unfake_it.php' file into the wp-content/plugins/tt_unfake_it/ directory. (This should happen automatically, once you unzipped the archive; just make sure, the location is correct.)
